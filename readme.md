sure that you are on the right path.So here we are to help you with your journey to become a succesful coder in your field of your choice. **Automatic Journey** is here to give 
you a headstart to your journey of the skill. We provide you with the most effective tested roadmap to get you started. All you need to do is visit our page and take that first 
step of clicking the link and following the guidelines blindly.

## Usage

The website features a really minimalist design and interface with single click links. We made our sincere efforts in organizing the links in a branch structure to make it easy to 
read and understand.
## Future Prospects
